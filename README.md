<h5 align='center'> My name is Emanuel, and I'm a Mathematician & Data Scientist. </h5>

<h5 align='center'> I'm happy you found your way down here! 🥳<br> If you come across any issues in one of my projects or have suggestions for improvement, I would love to hear from you! I firmly believe in the power of diverse perspectives and I'm always excited to embrace new insights and ideas! 🌍 </h5>

<h5 align='center'> As metaphorically illustrated by the above GIF of an RGB decomposition of a network graph, my approach to working with data involves a meticulous examination of its intricacies from various angles. This process allows me to unlock hidden gems of insight, inspires me methodologically and ultimately enables me to construct robust, production-grade deliverables. 💎</h5>
<h5 align='center'> Quite evidently I like R quite a lot. 🧑‍💻 <br> However I also very much appreciate Python, which currently is my most used programming language in my day to day work.🐍 <br>Who knows, maybe Mojo will be my next adventure! 🔥  </h5>
